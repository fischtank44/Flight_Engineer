Full spectrum aviation business study. 

This is a multi-facited analysis of an aviation business problem that grew from aircraft engine data available from NASA. [PCoE Datasets](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/). This dataset is the publicly available: [Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/publications/#turbofan).

## Engine Training Data: [Data Files](https://github.com/fischtank44/Engine_training_data/tree/master/Data_Files) 

These files demonstrate analysis of data from a NASA study of turbofan engine failures. This is a front to back evaluation of the data beginning by using SQL to extract data, excel to clean data, and analyizing data in Tableau. Finally, two outputs are provided. The first is a predictive formula that attempts to provide an estimate of cycles remaining and the second is a real time assesment of the engines current health using visualizations all in Tableau. 


## Data import:

The information from the training set needed to be imported to pandas for analysis. Each engine, the number of cycles, and data collected from each observation were included in the data. The information was relatively clean and organized; however, it did not have an included target variable. 


## Training and test sets:

The training dataset was chosen by randomly sampling 80% of the engines that were run during the experiment. The remaining 20% of the engines were held in reserve for the test set. Some of the features were not used or where not predictive. The features for the model were evaluated based on their standard deviation and only those that had values more than  0.01 where included in the list of features to train to.   


## Target variable:

Since each engine was run to failure, the first target variable chosen was the exact number of cycles to failure for each engine. The maximum number of cycles that each engine was able to run varied from 192 â€“ 300 cycles. Thus it was possible for one engine to start with 250 life cycles remaining and another to begin its life with only 175 cycles. 

The second variable was optimized for a logistic model. The value for y was derived from the max number of cycles the engine operated (ex. 250 cycles) and the target variable was set to start at 1/250th (close to 0) of life remaining and end at 250/250 (close to 1). A value for when an engine needs to be removed will be selected based on the results of the cost benefit analysis.


## Models:
Linear regression with knots and splines. 
Each feature that was included in the training data set was graphed against cycles until failure and plotted with a smoothing line designed to show potential knots in each feature. These features where then to the original dataframe which was transformed using each of the knots as a new column.  The target variable was initially set at number of cycles until failure.

Linear regression with a log transformed target variable.
The plots of the first model indicated that the features contained data that was increasing/decreasing at a rate that was accelerating as the engines approached the end of their life cycle.  This is an indication that a log transformation would be useful. The first transformation was a log transformation of the y variable. Log variables started as high as 5.8 (350 cycles of life) and continued down to 0 (one life cycle remaining). The results where significantly improved.
